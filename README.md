#### Research (Neuroscience, Imaging Genetics & Neurodegeneration) | Data Science

I completed my PhD in Biology (summa cum laude) from the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, PAS, where I conducted research in cognitive neuroscience and imaging genetics. I led a project funded by the Polish National Science Centre, investigating how various polymorphisms in Alzheimer’s disease risk genes affect their carriers. This work resulted in the release of the PEARL-Neuro Dataset, which I currently curate.

I navigate between two worlds — science & art, technology & nature — as my other great passion is [wildlife photography](https://ptdz.pl).
