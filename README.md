#### Research (Neuroscience, Imaging Genetics & Neurodegeneration) | Data Science

I obtained my PhD in Biology (doctorate cum laude) from the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, where I conducted research in cognitive neuroscience and imaging genetics. My scientific interests focus on structural and functional neuroimaging of the aging brain, with an emphasis on the early detection and prediction of neurodegeneration. I led a project funded by the Polish National Science Centre, exploring how various polymorphisms in Alzheimer’s disease risk genes influence their carriers. This work led to the development and release of the PEARL-Neuro Dataset, which I currently curate.

Here, I primarily share open-source code for simple plugins and scripts to support data analysis — especially for EEG data — and maintain a curated list called SORTED, featuring interesting ideas, tools, and resources in neuroscience, data management, and data science.

I navigate between two worlds — science & art, technology & nature — as my other great passion is [wildlife photography](https://ptdz.pl).
